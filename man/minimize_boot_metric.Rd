\title{Minimize a metric function in binary classification after bootstrapping}
\usage{
minimize_boot_metric(data, x, class, metric_func = youden, pos_class = NULL,
  neg_class = NULL, direction, boot_cut = 200, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble in which the columns that are given in x
and class can be found.}

\item{x}{(character) The variable name to be used for classification,
e.g. predictions or test values.}

\item{class}{(character) The variable name indicating class membership.}

\item{metric_func}{(function) A function that computes a single number
metric to be maximized. See description.}

\item{pos_class}{The value of class that indicates the positive class.}

\item{neg_class}{The value of class that indicates the negative class.}

\item{direction}{(character) Use ">=" or "<=" to select whether an x value
>= or <= the cutoff predicts the positive class.}

\item{boot_cut}{(numeric) Number of bootstrap repetitions over which the mean
optimal cutpoint is calculated.}

\item{...}{To capture further arguments that are always passed to the method
function by cutpointr. The cutpointr function passes data, x, class,
metric_func, direction, pos_class and neg_class to the method function.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the column optimal_cutpoint
}
\description{
Given a function for computing a metric in metric_func, this function
bootstraps the data boot_cut times and
minimizes the metric by selecting an optimal cutpoint. The returned
optimal cutpoint is the mean of all optimal cutpoints that were
determined in the bootstrap samples.
}
\details{
The metric function should accept the following inputs:
\itemize{
 \item tp: vector of number of true positives
 \item fp: vector of number of false positives
 \item tn: vector of number of true negatives
 \item fn: vector of number of false negatives
}

The above inputs are arrived at by using all unique values in x, Inf, and
-Inf as possible cutpoints for classifying the variable in class.
