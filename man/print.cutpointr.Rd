\usage{
\method{print}{cutpointr}(x, n = NULL, width = NULL, n_extra = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a cutpointr object.}

\item{n}{number of rows to print.}

\item{width}{width of text output to generate. This defaults to NULL,
which displays only the columns that fit on one screen. You can also set
width = Inf to override this default and always print all columns.}

\item{n_extra}{number of extra columns to print abbreviated information for,
if the width is too small for the entire tibble.}

\item{...}{further arguements.}
}
\description{
Prints the cutpointr object like a tbl_df.
With versions of tibble later than 1.3.0 printing tibbles with `width = Inf`
does not wrap columns nicely so the default has been changed to `width = NULL`.
