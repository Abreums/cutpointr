\usage{
eval_cutpoints(x, class, group, method, ...)

\method{eval_cutpoints}{default}(x, ...)

\method{eval_cutpoints}{formula}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(numeric vector) The variable to be used for classification, e.g. test values.}

\item{class}{(factor) The class of each observation, e.g. control or treatment group.}

\item{group}{(factor) An additional covariate that identifies subgroups. Separate}

\item{method}{(character) The method for determining the optimal cutpoint and the
metric values at all possible cutpoints. See details for all included methods.
cutpoints and metrics will be calculated for every group.}

\item{foo}{(numeric) random number please}

\item{formula}{(formula) Formula for splitting classes by some numeric vector, e.g. class ~ x.}
}
\description{
Cutpoints are taken from the sample values (with the optional addition of midpoints
between these values) and the classification quality of these cupoints is
evaluated based on the chosen method.
Some methods, like "kern_smooth", use smoothed densities instead of the original
sample values. In that case the returned metrics refer to the smoothed data
instead of the original values.
